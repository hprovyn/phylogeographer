PHYLOGEOGRAPHER

Computation of theoretical migration paths of uniparental lineages based on geolocated, dated samples and a tree with date estimates

The current version is not usable by others, it contains hard-coded references to my data sources and file structure.

In the future I plan to move all migration calculation logic to a package usable by other researchers.
